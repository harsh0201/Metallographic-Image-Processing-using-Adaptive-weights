# Metallographic-Image-Processing-using-Adaptive-weights
Implemented a research paper on Metallographic Image Processing using Adaptive weights. 

To see the accuracy of thsi method we used an metallographic image and first blurr it.
Then we use different methods on the blurred image such as mean filter , median filter and adaptive weights filter.
